Problem Statement

You are working as a Devops Administrator. You’ve been tasked to deploy a multitier application on Kubernetes Cluster. The application is a NodeJS application
available on Docker Hub with the following name:
devopsedu/employee
This NodeJS application works with a mongo database. MongoDB image is available
on DockerHub with the following name:
mongo
You are required to deploy this application on Kubernetes:
• NodeJS is available on port 8888 in the container and will be reaching out to port
27017 for mongo database connection
• MongoDB will be accepting connections on port 27017
You must deploy this application using the CLI.
Once your application is up and running, ensure you can add an employee from the
NodeJS application and verify by going to Get Employee page and retrieving your input.
Hint: Name the Mongo DB Service and deployment, specifically as “mongo”.
